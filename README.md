# sudokuSolver
This script will generate sudoku puzzles and then solve them.
The script takes an integer 0 - 81 as an argument, to determine the number of clues present in the generated puzzle. Generally, about 32 clues is considered easy for a human and about 20 is considered very difficult.

THIS DOES NOT GENERATE "TRUE" SUDOKUS:
A "real" sudoku is one with only a single possible solution, which is not what this program does. I am currently working to implement this feature which would make this much more useful.
